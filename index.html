                <h4>New passions</h4>
                <p class="shadows-into-light-regular">Learning to code has become a new passion even though it tests my patience learning something new at 40 years of age.  
                    I will diligently work to complete the front end certification so i can move on learn other programming languages.
                    Im not sure what path i would eventualy go into but dabling in gaming and AI both seem fun right now. </p>

                <h4>Old passions</h4>
                <p class="shadows-into-light-regular" >I used to love playing sports and gaming alot as a teenager and young adult but the options to play sports dwindled as i grew older.
                    Gaming was much easier as it was more readily available after a long day of work.  As of now my last sport i get to enjoy is playing 
                    golf with a few friends every summer in a league.</p>
